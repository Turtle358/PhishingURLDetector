To install the firefox addon go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, "Load temporary addon" then navigagte to the repo and into firefoxExtension and import manifest.json

Currently the model must be loaded locally on your computer, to change this you can always change the API's ip to your local ip for the network, allowing other computers to use the API and extension
on your network

You can download my current model from https://huggingface.co/Turtle357/PhishingURLDetector
or run
```sh
git lfs init
git clone https://huggingface.co/Turtle357/PhishingURLDetector
```
